# Dead ends in square-free digit walks

These files accompany the paper [arXiv:TODO](TODO).
This paper also has an accompanying [blog post](TODO).

The formal proofs provided in this work were developed and verified using **Lean 4.26.0**. Compatibility with earlier or later versions is not guaranteed due to the evolving nature of the Lean 4 compiler and its core libraries.

## Input files

- `dead-ends.tex`: natural language description of the problem
- `task.md`: description of the task to be completed (deferring to `dead-ends.tex`)
- `.environment`: specifies the Lean version

## Output files (Run with Lean 4.26.0)

- `problem.lean`: translation of the problem statement into formal language (Lean),
  including the answer itself (computed by AxiomProver)
- `solution.lean`: solution in formal language (Lean)
